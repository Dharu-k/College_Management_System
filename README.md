The College Management System is a comprehensive system designed to manage all aspects of a student's academic and personal information. 
It serves as a centralized platform that allows students, faculty, and administrators to access, manage, and update information related to academic records, attendance, fees, and more. 
My project implements various modules using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management. It includes the following modules:
         1) Login Module: Allows users to log in using their username and password credentials.
         2) Home Page Module: Displays the main interface after logging in, providing access to different functionalities.
         3) Biodata Module: Allows students to view their biodata information.
         4) Marks Module: Displays student's marks and calculates CGPA.
         5) Attendance Module: Displays student's attendance details.
         6) Events Module: Provides information about college events.
         7) Fees Module: Displays fee details and balance.
         8) Library Module: Displays books taken by the student from the library.
Each module is implemented as a separate Java class and interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve and display relevant information. The GUI is designed using Java Swing components to provide a user-friendly experience.
