The College Management System is a comprehensive system designed to manage all aspects of a student's academic and personal information. 
It serves as a centralized platform that allows students, faculty, and administrators to access, manage, and update information related to academic records, attendance, fees, and more. 
The system streamlines the operations of the college and improves communication and efficiency for all stakeholders.
